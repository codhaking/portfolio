                    <p>my name is onwubiko okem Precious. I am a 23-year-old aspiring fullstack developer with an over active imagination that tries its best to seclude me from reality and drown me in a never ending montage of brilliant stories and endless possibilities. I am also studying to be a Mechanical Engineer. I don’t fancy myself the sporty kind, though I do engage in the barest minimum for cardiovascular reasons. I love to eat, laugh and live even though it gets tiring sometimes. I consider my best trait to be my loyalty and willingness to try new things which is near paradoxical as I don’t take too kindly to big changes. As an only child of two academics, academics play a big role in my life but only to the extent of practical application with a result oriented goal. I know nothing of wine tasting or art and sculpture, they’re a little too high class for my tastes. I believe my biggest achievement was getting published in WSA, it made me believe that all those hours I spent clacking away at my keyboard were not completely futile and that someone out there was interested in what I had to say. I had a voice and someone was listening, it is by far, my biggest achievement. I have really lofty aspirations, but at the end of the day I think I’d truly be satisfied if I die having lived a happy life. I’m simple that way.</p>
